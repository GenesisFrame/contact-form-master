codeigniter-contact-form
========================

Basic contact form controller and views (contact form and success message) for CodeIgniter. 


	Editing the settings:
	(They should be in a config file, but for
	a basic part of your site i've included
	it in controllers/contact.php)

	Important settings:

	$sendEmailTo: Where to send the email

	$headerView: set to null if you don't want
		to show a header. If anything is set
		it will load that view before the
		content
	
	$footerView: Same as $headerView but the footer

	$spam_question / $spam_answer: Set a basic
		question to avoid bots. E.g. 
		'what colour is the sky' & 'blue'
	

	Usage:
	Edit the protected variables at start of class.
	If headerView/footerView is null it won't 
	load those views. Assuming you keep your header
	and footer in /views/template/ it will work
	with the defaults.

	There is no ip logging, basic spam protection 
	(in form of question/answer - easiest for humans
	but also easiest for spammers!). 

	Just a simple form :)

	Just go to site_url("contact") (i.e. http://domain.com/index.php/contact
	 and it should	work out of the box. 


	$this->data is used for any data sent to the views.
 	It isn't used here, but I tend to use that pattern
	with my template files so just included it here.
